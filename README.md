Kopia is a simple, cross-platform tool for managing encrypted backups in the cloud. It provides fast, incremental backups, secure, client-side end-to-end encryption, compression and data deduplication.

Unlike other cloud backup solutions, the user is in full control of the backup storage and responsible for purchasing one of the cloud storage products (such as [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/)), which offer great durability and availability for the data.
