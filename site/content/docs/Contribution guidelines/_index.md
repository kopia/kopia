## Contacting Developers

* Using [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/kopia/shared_invite/enQtNjMxMTcxMTMxNDYwLWI4YzVkMzFhN2QwZGVhMzgwZDk2MGUzNmZhOWZkMmIzMDBlYzhmZTI3NTYxZWE1YWI4YWY1N2VhMGM4ZjJiNGQ) is the quickest way to get in touch with developers.

## Submitting issues

* If you find a bug or have a feature request, please submit an issue at https://github.com/kopia/kopia/issues

## Security issues

* If you find a security issue that you want to disclose privately, please contact `jaak@jkowalski.net` or send a direct message on Slack.

## Submitting code via Pull Requests

* We follow the [Github Pull Request Model](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) for all contributions.
* For large bodies of work, we recommend creating an issue and labelling it `design` outlining the feature that you wish to build, and describing how it will be implemented. This gives a chance for review to happen early, and ensures no wasted effort occurs.
* For new features, documentation must be included.
* Once review has occurred, please rebase your PR down to a single commit. This will ensure a nice clean Git history.
