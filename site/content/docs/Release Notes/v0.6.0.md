We are very excited to announce the 0.6 release of Kopia! This is a big milestone on the way to an upcoming 1.0 release and there have not only been a large number of changes across the stack but also growth of the community.

This version brings manny performance, usability and stability improvements listed below, adds supports for new providers and CLI options and introduces major new features described below:

* [Maintenance Tasks](/docs/maintenance/)
* [Repository Server](/docs/repository-server/)
* [Repository Synchronization](/docs/repository-synchronization/)

### Upgrade notes

* Upgrading from 0.5.x is supported and should be automatic
* Upgrading from 0.4.0 or earlier is not officially supported, it may work but use at your own risk. It's strongly recommended to create new repository using v0.6.0 and migrate existing snapshots as outlined in the documentation. After v0.6.0 the deprecated encryption and hashing schemes from v0.4.0 will be removed.

### Key Changes

#### Core

* big performance improvements when snapshotting large directories [#331](https://github.com/kopia/kopia/pull/331)
* improvements for dealing with eventually-consistent stores (S3) [#437](https://github.com/kopia/kopia/pull/437)
* GC safety improvements to resolve race condition when content is re-referenced when about to be deleted [#420](https://github.com/kopia/kopia/pull/420)
* added OpenCensus [#339](https://github.com/kopia/kopia/pull/339)
* introduced explicit maintenance operations that perform periodic repository cleanup/compaction [#411](https://github.com/kopia/kopia/pull/411)
* disabled automatic compaction on repository opening - moved to maintenance tasks
* added AsyncWrites to ObjectWriter, which improves performanceâ€¦ [#369](https://github.com/kopia/kopia/pull/369)
* object: ensure that all I objects have a content prefix which improves locality by putting them in q packs
* deduplicate multiple policies for the same source in policy manager, fixes #391
* fixed race condition during Open() where we may read incomplete file
* deprecated NONE algorithm, will not be available for new repositories [#395](https://github.com/kopia/kopia/pull/395)

* moved creating cache directory from connect to first use [#450](https://github.com/kopia/kopia/pull/450)

* repo: refactored public API [#318](https://github.com/kopia/kopia/pull/318)

* auto-ignore kopia cache directories when creating snapshots [#524](https://github.com/kopia/kopia/pull/524)

#### Infrastructure
