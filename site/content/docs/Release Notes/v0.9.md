**NOTE: Kopia v0.9 is out. You can download it from:**

https://github.com/kopia/kopia/releases/latest.

This release focuses on improvements to the repository format, stability and performance. 

The new repository index format enables efficient append-only operation where delete permission is not required, removes the need for quick maintenance and enables internal content-level compression. 

Kopia now also supports repository password change (new repositories only).

Big thanks to @pawitp for contributing major performance improvement to splitters [#1251](https://github.com/kopia/kopia/pull/1251), which improves large file upload performance by 
up to 30%.
